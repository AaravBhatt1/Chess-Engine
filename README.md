# Haskell-Chess

## A chess engine built with haskell that users can play against.

This project is a chess engine that I have built using haskell, so that I could improve my functional programming skills. Users can play chess against the AI using a physical board or a board editor such as the [board editor on Lichess](https://lichess.org/editor), typing in their moves when prompted and moving pieces where the program tells it to for the AI.

Features include:

- Users can play chess using the app (however, some rules have been removed)
- Users can play against the chess engine, which plays accurately
